This file describes major user-visible changes between snapshot releases
that are available from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/rumpkernel/files/snapshots/

Note that most improvements due to the bumping of the NetBSD timestamp
are not described.  For a more complete list of NetBSD changes, see:
http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-current/src/doc/CHANGES


	[changes not yet part of a snapshot]

+ update NetBSD timestamp to 20140424 1200UTC
+ added support for aio syscalls (via NetBSD)
+ enable support for shared libs with the GNU gold linker and on
  FreeBSD and OpenBSD

	[changes that will happen when the timestamp is bumped]

+ librumpdev_scsitest is no longer installed (it was a test library
  for the SCSI stack, and is not required for normal operation.  The
  SCSI protocol stack is still offered as librumpdev_scsipi)

	Snapshot 5.4.2014

+ fix a critical bug in librumpclient (caused stdin to be closed)
+ actually include the rumpkern_time changes that were supposed to
  be included in the previous snapshot
+ linux syscall compat for time-related syscalls

	Snapshot 2.4.2014

+ add Android support
+ on Linux, remote clients can be interrupted with a signal while they
  are blocking on a rump kernel syscall (previously only SIGSTOP/SIGKILL
  were possible)
+ use sysconf to get processor count on all platforms
+ functionality provided by the rumpkern_time component is now in
  librump (i.e. do not use -lrumpkern_time)

	Snapshot 17.3.2014

+ update NetBSD timestamp to 20140317 2200UTC
+ compile options affecting rump kernels are now documented in
  src/sys/rump/README.compileopts. to access, run
  "./buildrump.sh checkout" first
+ a high-performance version of "curlwp" will be automatically
  used if supported by the target
+ rump kernels were fixed to work in static binaries with
  e.g. glibc and musl
+ support for NPF firewall driver has been added
+ many sysctl nodes required by rumprun utilities now available by
  default, including kern.urandom, kern.rawpartition, etc.
+ add rump_wmd(1) (short for Where's My Dependency).  Given a
  rump kernel component, rump_wmd lists all the components that
  are needed for successful linking
+ even more Linux syscall compat fixes (via NetBSD)
+ OpenBSD support
+ armeb support

	Snapshot 3.1.2014

+ allow IPv4-only and IPv6-only rump kernels, i.e. libnet_netinet
  provides only IPv4, and libnet_netinet6 provides only IPv6
+ update NetBSD timestamp to 20140103 1400UTC
+ allow user to specify any debug/optimization compiler flags by
  setting BUILDRUMP_DBG in the env
+ Linux syscall compat improvements (mostly via NetBSD)
+ support IPv6 address configuration in the netconfig component
+ fix NetBSD 5.x host support

	Snapshot 6.12.2013
